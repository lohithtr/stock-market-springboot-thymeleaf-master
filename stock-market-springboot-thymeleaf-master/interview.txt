1. How to Mention the Project on Your Resume

Project Name: Stock Market Application (Spring Boot + Thymeleaf + MySQL)
Description:
Developed a stock market application with separate modules for admin and user roles using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL.
Integrated external APIs like Alpha Vantage (for fetching stock data) and Razorpay (for wallet recharges).
Implemented session-based user authentication (without Spring Security) and OTP-based registration via Java Mail Sender.
Admin module: Admin can log in, add new stocks using tickers, manage stock data, and view stock transaction statistics.
User module: Users can register, log in, recharge their wallet, view stocks, purchase them, and track their portfolio.

Key Technologies Used:
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
Frontend: Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS
Database: MySQL
APIs: Alpha Vantage, Razorpay, Java Mail Sender

Responsibilities:
Designed and developed the backend with RESTful services for stock management.
Implemented user registration, OTP verification, and session management.
Integrated Alpha Vantage API for fetching real-time stock data and Razorpay API for wallet transactions.
Created dynamic pages using Thymeleaf templates and managed the frontend interaction with the backend.

2. How to Explain This Project in an Interview as a Fresher

Project Explanation:
When explaining this project in an interview, keep it clear, concise, and structured. Here’s how you can break it down:
Interviewer: "Tell me about a project you've worked on."
You:
"I developed a Stock Market Application as part of my learning experience, where I implemented both admin and user modules using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. The application helps users view and purchase stocks, while admins can add and manage stocks in the system."
"The Admin module allows stock management. Admins can log in, enter a stock ticker, and fetch real-time stock data from the Alpha Vantage API. This data is then added to the database, and admins can track the stock transactions."
"For the User module, I implemented OTP-based registration using Java Mail Sender. Once registered, users can log in, view stocks, and recharge their wallet through Razorpay API to buy stocks. I also created a portfolio feature where users can track their stock holdings and sell them."
"The entire application uses a session-based authentication system rather than Spring Security, allowing me to manage user logins and access rights simply."

Technologies:
"I used Spring Boot for the backend, Thymeleaf for creating dynamic web pages, and MySQL for database management. The project integrates external APIs like Alpha Vantage for fetching stock data and Razorpay for wallet recharges."

Challenges Faced:
"One challenge I faced was integrating the Alpha Vantage API for real-time stock data. The API required me to process a lot of data, and I had to ensure the data was stored in the correct format for the application to manage it effectively."
"Another challenge was managing session-based authentication since I wasn't using Spring Security. I had to make sure sessions were handled correctly for both admins and users to avoid unauthorized access."

Learning:
"I learned how to work with external APIs, handle RESTful requests using RestTemplate, and manage user sessions manually. I also gained experience in integrating payment gateways (like Razorpay) and sending emails for OTP verification."

3. Possible Cross-Questions You Might Face

A. On Technical Implementation:
Interviewer: "Why did you choose to use session management instead of Spring Security?"
Answer: "Since I wanted to keep the application simple and didn't need extensive security features for this small project, I opted for session management. It allowed me to understand the fundamentals of user authentication and session tracking."

Interviewer: "How does your application handle concurrent users, especially during stock transactions?"
Answer: "For this project, I ensured that stock transactions are handled safely by implementing appropriate transaction management using Spring Data JPA. In a more complex system, I would have incorporated optimistic locking or pessimistic locking to ensure data consistency across concurrent users."

Interviewer: "How did you handle API rate limits with Alpha Vantage?"
Answer: "I did check the rate limits of the Alpha Vantage API and implemented a caching mechanism in the application. I used an in-memory cache for stock data, so if the same data was requested again, it wouldn't call the API unnecessarily."

B. On Your Knowledge of APIs:
Interviewer: "Can you explain how you integrated the Razorpay API into your application?"
Answer: "I used the Razorpay API to handle wallet recharges. When a user requests to add money to their wallet, they are redirected to Razorpay's checkout page, where they can make payments. Once the payment is successful, Razorpay sends a callback to the server to update the user's wallet balance."

Interviewer: "What did you use for sending OTP emails, and why?"
Answer: "I used Java Mail Sender for sending OTP emails. It’s simple to configure with Spring Boot and provides a reliable way to handle email sending within the application."

C. On Business Logic:
Interviewer: "How do you ensure that the stock prices are updated regularly for the users?"
Answer: "The stock prices are fetched from Alpha Vantage API on demand. If needed, I would implement a scheduled task (using Spring Scheduler) to update the stock prices periodically, but in the current project, it happens when the admin adds a stock or when a user views the stock."

D. On Database Management:
Interviewer: "How did you handle database transactions when a user buys or sells a stock?"
Answer: "I used Spring Data JPA to handle transactions. Whenever a stock is bought or sold, I update both the transactions table and the user's portfolio in a single transaction to ensure consistency."

E. On Frontend:
Interviewer: "How did you use Thymeleaf for dynamic content?"
Answer: "I used Thymeleaf to dynamically render stock data, user portfolios, and transaction details on the frontend. For example, when a user views their portfolio, Thymeleaf loops through the stocks they own and displays them."

4. How to Present Your Project as a Fresher:
Show Your Enthusiasm: As a fresher, showing that you’re passionate and proud of your work is key. Make sure you communicate your learning process and the technologies you worked with.

Focus on Problem-Solving: Focus on the challenges you solved (e.g., integrating third-party APIs, managing user sessions) and how you approached them.
